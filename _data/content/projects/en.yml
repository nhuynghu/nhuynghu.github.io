        > **Abstract** This study explores the interplay between risk attitudes and trading network resilience of 
        trading networks in small-scale rural farming communities in Vietnam. Leveraging survey data from farming 
        households across three villages characterized by limited network resilience, we uncover evidence of a positive 
        association between risk aversion and the number of engaged traders, while loss aversion exhibits a negative relationship. 
        Conversely, in villages with fewer traders, we observe a positive correlation between procrastination and the number of trading links. 
        These findings highlight the complex dynamics between behavioral factors and trading network resilience, underscoring 
        the importance of considering village-specific dynamics when devising strategies to enhance network resilience in rural farming communities.

         > **Abstract** This study presents a comparative analysis of the association between the educational and occupational achievements of native and immigrant parents
         and those of their children. In comparison with children of natives, children of immigrants are less likely to depend on their parents' occupation. More importantly,
         parental education is of greater importance to both the educational and occupational achievements of immigrant children. Especially, it is the most important resource
         for children of immigrant parents who tend to have higher levels of education than native parents but face occupational challenges in the labour market. The findings 
         shed light on the value of human capital. Regardless of parental economic conditions, immigrant children, therefore, have the potential to achieve significant gains 
         and make valuable contributions to their host countries by building upon the education of their parents.

         > **Abstract** The presence of international graduates as a source of skilled labour has been growing in parallel with the increasing public concern 
         about their impacts on the outcomes of domestic ones across receiving countries. In light of a significant and sustained increase followed by a decline 
         in the supply of overseas students due to migration policy reformations, this study leverages those exogenous changes to provide the effects
         of overseas graduates on the employment opportunities and wages of their domestic peers. In general, overseas graduates are not likely to negatively 
         impact employment opportunities and suppress the wages of domestic graduates. Especially, during the period marked by a slowdown in the inflow of 
         overseas students, a further decline in their supply could lead to around 2% lower probabilities of employment for domestic graduates. 
         The results reinforce the complementary effects between native and immigrant workers, particularly in a narrower yet important segment of the labour market. 
         In this market, both native and immigrant workers are recent graduates, possessing similar levels and qualities of education, alongside comparable experience.
