        > **Abstract** We explore the relationship between behavioral factors, most notably risk aversion, procrastination and gender, 
        and the resilience of trading networks in small scale rural farming in Vietnam. Rural farmers are highly dependent on intermediary 
        traders to bring products to market. We survey farming households in three villages to obtain data on the trading network. 
        In all three villages we find the network is not resilient with the typical farmer relying on one or two traders with whom they have 
        traded for many years. We find some evidence that risk aversion is associated with a household engaging with fewer traders. 
        We also find an effect on the gender, husband or wife, of the person in the household with most responsibility for trading decisions.
        We argue that the use of smartphone technology to monitor crop quality in real time may help facilitate link formation in the network.
