        > **Abstract** This study explores the interplay between risk attitudes and trading network resilience of 
        trading networks in small-scale rural farming communities in Vietnam. Leveraging survey data from farming 
        households across three villages characterized by limited network resilience, we uncover evidence of a positive 
        association between risk aversion and the number of engaged traders, while loss aversion exhibits a negative relationship. 
        Conversely, in villages with fewer traders, we observe a positive correlation between procrastination and the number of trading links. 
        These findings highlight the complex dynamics between behavioral factors and trading network resilience, underscoring 
        the importance of considering village-specific dynamics when devising strategies to enhance network resilience in rural farming communities.

         > **Abstract** The presence of international graduates as a source of skilled labour has been growing in parallel with the increasing public concern 
         of their impacts on the outcomes of domestic ones across receiving countries. In light of a significant and sustained increase followed by a decline 
         in the supply of overseas students as results of migration policies reformation, this study leverages those exogenous changes to provide the effects
         of overseas graduates on the employment opportunities and wage of their domestic peers. In general, overseas graduates are not likely to exert negative 
         impacts on the employment opportunities and suppress wage of domestic graduates. Especially, during the period marked by a slowdown in the inflow of 
         overseas students, a further decline in their supply could lead to around 12\% lower probabilities of employment for domestic graduates. 
         The results reinforce the complementary effects between native and immigrants workers, particularly in a narrower yet important segment of the labour market. 
         In this market, both native and immigrant workers are recent graduates, possessing similar levels and qualities of education, alongside comparable experience.
