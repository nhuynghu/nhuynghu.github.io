        > **Abstract** We explore the relationship between behavioral factors, most notably risk aversion, procrastination and gender, 
        and the resilience of trading networks in small scale rural farming in Vietnam. Rural farmers are highly dependent on intermediary 
        traders to bring products to market. We survey farming households in three villages to obtain data on the trading network. 
        In all three villages we find the network is not resilient with the typical farmer relying on one or two traders with whom they have 
        traded for many years. We find some evidence that risk aversion is associated with a household engaging with fewer traders. 
        We also find an effect on the gender, husband or wife, of the person in the household with most responsibility for trading decisions.
        We argue that the use of smartphone technology to monitor crop quality in real time may help facilitate link formation in the network.

         > **Abstract** The presence of international graduates as a source of skilled labour has been growing in parallel with the increasing public concern 
         of their impacts on the outcomes of domestic ones across receiving countries. In light of a significant and sustained increase followed by a decline 
         in the supply of overseas students as results of migration policies reformation, this study leverages those exogenous changes to provide the effects
         of overseas graduates on the employment opportunities and wage of their domestic peers. In general, overseas graduates are not likely to exert negative 
         impacts on the employment opportunities and suppress wage of domestic graduates. Especially, during the period marked by a slowdown in the inflow of 
         overseas students, a further decline in their supply could lead to around 12\% lower probabilities of employment for domestic graduates. 
         The results reinforce the complementary effects between native and immigrants workers, particularly in a narrower yet important segment of the labour market. 
         In this market, both native and immigrant workers are recent graduates, possessing similar levels and qualities of education, alongside comparable experience.
