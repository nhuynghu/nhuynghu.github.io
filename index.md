Hello! Iâ€™m NhuY, and I hold a PhD in Economics from the City, University of London. My research primarily focuses on labour economics, where I delve into the outcomes of immigrants and their impact on the labour market. I also have a keen interest in development economics. My current study is dedicated to exploring strategies for improving the income and welfare of households in rural areas.
